# GitHub Copilot Instructions
WARNING! Never create any fallback system unless specifically told. No stupid fake fallbacks.

Keep all code simple, easy and modular. Use multiple files if needed. Never create large files. Keep functions small and single purpose. Each file will have a specific purpose of a single domain.Write the absolute minimal code to achieve that purpose with concise comments.

Use meaningful names for files, functions, and variables. Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood. Use comments to explain complex logic.

Before making a new file always make a file and folder structure plan instead of randomly creating disorganized mess. You must have a clear plan of how files and folders will be organized for the new file and how it will integrate with the current system modularly and can be used anywhere however we want.

# Coding Standards
Keep functions under 30 lines.
Follow modular design principles.
Use single-line comments: // acquire lock before modifying books[].
Avoid nested ifs; use early returns.
Name variables clearly: avgWaitTime not awt.
compile by build.bat then 2 for modular
